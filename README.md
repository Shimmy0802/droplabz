# DropLabz

**Professional infrastructure for managing Solana NFT communities.**

DropLabz is a community operations platform that gives you complete control over your whitelists, collaborations, pre-sales, and member access—all verified through Discord and Solana wallets.

## What is DropLabz?

DropLabz is **not a marketplace**. It's a **toolkit for community managers** who need professional, secure infrastructure to:

- **Create verified whitelists** with custom Discord role and Solana wallet requirements
- **Manage pre-sales** with tiered allocations and on-chain eligibility tracking
- **Coordinate collaborations** between projects and communities
- **Control community access** with role-based permissions and member management
- **Automate operations** with scheduled winner draws and Discord integration

Everything is verified—Discord roles, Solana wallets, on-chain holdings—and you maintain complete control over your data and community.

## How It Works

### 1. Create Your Community

Sign up with Discord OAuth or email/password, then link your Discord server. You'll get an admin dashboard where you control everything.

### 2. Set Up Requirements

Define what you're looking for:

- Which Discord roles participants need
- What Solana wallets they must own
- Token or NFT holdings required
- Max participants allowed

### 3. Launch Your Event

Post your whitelist, pre-sale, or collaboration to your community. Participants connect their Solana wallet and submit entries.

### 4. Verify Automatically

DropLabz verifies entries in real-time:

- Checks Discord membership and roles
- Verifies Solana wallet ownership
- Validates on-chain holdings
- Flags potential duplicates

### 5. Pick Winners & Export

Manually select winners or let DropLabz auto-draw. Export verified wallet addresses in seconds—ready for your smart contract or airdrop tool.

## Security & Verification

DropLabz uses **verified, secure** verification:

- **Discord verification**: Checks roles, account age, server membership
- **Solana wallet verification**: Confirms wallet ownership via signature
- **On-chain eligibility**: Verifies token/NFT holdings directly on Solana
- **Duplicate detection**: Identifies potential scams and multi-entry attempts
- **Audit logging**: All admin actions are logged for compliance
- **One entry per wallet**: Enforced automatically per event

Your data is isolated and secure. Only you and your community members can see their own information.

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need a Discord server?**  
A: It's optional but recommended. You can manage communities on DropLabz without Discord, but Discord integration makes announcements and winner assignment much easier.

**Q: Can I require specific tokens or NFTs?**  
A: Yes! Pro tier and above support custom Solana token and NFT requirements. We check balances directly on-chain.

**Q: What happens if someone tries to enter twice?**  
A: Duplicate detection automatically flags suspicious patterns. You can manually mark entries as ineligible before drawing winners.

**Q: How do I export winners?**  
A: Click "Export" and choose "Winners" or "All Entries". Download a CSV with verified wallet addresses ready for your smart contract.

**Q: Is my data safe?**  
A: All data is encrypted and isolated by community. Only you can see your whitelist entries and member information.

**Q: Can I integrate with my own smart contracts?**  
A: Yes. Export wallet addresses and use them however you'd like—airdrop tools, claim contracts, allow lists, etc.
