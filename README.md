## What is DropLabz?

A toolkit for community managers to create verified whitelists, manage pre-sales, coordinate collaborations, and control community access—all verified through Discord and Solana wallets.

## Key Features

- **Verified Whitelists** — Custom Discord and Solana requirements with duplicate detection
- **Pre-Sales** — Tiered allocations with automatic wallet-based assignment
- **Collaborations** — Coordinate with partner projects and share verified lists
- **Community Management** — Role-based access control and member tracking
- **Discord Integration** — Post announcements, manage events, and auto-assign roles

2. Set up custom requirements (Discord roles, Solana wallets, tokens, NFTs)
3. Share your whitelist/pre-sale with your community
4. DropLabz verifies entries automatically
5. Pick winners and export wallet addresses
